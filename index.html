                    &body=Hon'ble President, %0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A
                    %20%20%20  I write this letter to bring to your attention important developments taking place in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep that are causing great distress to the people of the islands. The genesis of these issues arises from the appointment of Shri. Praful K Patel as the administrator of the UT. As the head of the UT, the administrator has taken a series of decisions that are anti-people and authoritarian. These range from the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the encroachment on personal liberty and individual freedom, the disruption of economic activity and livelihood of the people as well as implementing decisions that are patently against the religious sentiments of the overwhelming majority of inhabitants. It is unacceptable for a governing authority to have such blatant disregard for the people under its jurisdiction and continue to perpetuate decisions that cause great harm to them.
                    %0D%0A %20%20%20 Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the islands of Lakshadweep had been able to keep the virus out in 2020. However, post the appointment of the current administration certain quarantining guidelines were relaxed as a result of which the UT has seen over 4000 cases with over 20 deaths already. Further, the pressure on the health infrastructure of the islands has increased manifold leaving the population vulnerable and worried. The administration has also made decisions that affect major source of livelihood, fishing, as it has demolished storage spaces for fishing material and equipment that were earlier created by the previous administration. This has meant that thousands of fisherperson have lost the ability to productively engage in fishing and are unable to support themselves and their families. Similar arbitrary decisions have been taken that have resulted in the closure of Anganwadis and termination of numerous employees and contract workers across various departments of the UT administration.
                    %0D%0A %20%20%20 The population of Lakshadweep comprises mainly of Muslims, who constitute over 96% of the population. In accordance with the religious and cultural beliefs of the community, the consumption of alcohol was banned on the islands. However, in a recent decision, the administration has begun issuing liquor license under the guise of promoting tourism and individual freedom, thereby completely ignoring the sociocultural context of the area. It is ironic, that while this measure is being taken, the administration had no hesitation in proposing a prohibition on the sale, consumption, storage or transportation of beef, a food that is integral to a large population in Lakshadweep. Another sinister move to disenfranchise people of the island is the administrations draft panchayat regulations 2021 that makes any person with more than two children ineligible to contest panchayat elections. This decision finds no rationale in law and is patently unconstitutional. It is evident from these decisions that the administration of Lakshadweep no longer represents the interest of the people they govern. These administrative actions lack any rationale or demand and as such are attempts to disrupt the harmony and lives of the people of the administration. In these circumstances it is imperative that decisions and policies of the current administration are reviewed and revoked, wherever necessary, to align with the desires and demands of the people. Further, in case such anti-people and undemocratic actions continue under the current administration, I would urge you to consider the termination of the present administrator, Shri Praful K Patel's, tenure.
